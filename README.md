# Freemarker PoC

### Concepts Prooven
* Rendering a view with statically served image 
* Templating HTML files
* Returning templated String from Freemarker
* Posting to endpoint to return templated String
* Picture templating

*Note: there are a lot of weird nuances based on rendering HTML in a JLabel (i.e. img tags dont work, can't always use shorthand css like padding: 0 0 0 0, etc...)*
